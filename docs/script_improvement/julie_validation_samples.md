## Sample 5  (category: song_intro)
Here's the five stars with Atom Bomb Baby, a song that suggests they may not have made the most responsible choices when it came to relationships.

## Sample 6  (category: song_intro)
This next one goes out to all you dwellers looking for the perfect and I mean perfect spot for your camp. It's Bing Crosby singing Don't Fence Me In.

## Sample 7  (category: song_outro)
Hope that you all enjoyed that one, friends.

## Sample 8  (category: song_outro)
That was happy days are here again. Which, well, hey, you're alive, ain't ya? Pretty decent reason to be happy.

## Sample 9  (category: song_outro)
Oh my goodness, does that one swing. Oh, am I allowed to say that every part of that song is my favorite part? It's too hard to decide otherwise.

## Sample 10  (category: song_outro)
I feel like that could have gone on for another twenty minutes of solos, and it sure sounds like everyone playing would have loved doing it.

## Sample 11  (category: commentary)
I love that one because it sounds like a bunch of friends just hanging out and having a good time. Insect phobias aside, of course.

## Sample 12  (category: commentary)
Doesn't Billie Holiday just have the most beautiful voice. Every time I've heard that song since I was a little girl, I've just been carried away by it.

## Sample 13  (category: commentary)
I know it's not the same for everyone, but for me. There are moments where I miss where I came from and the family and friends no longer with us. Be grateful for what you have, friends, but don't forget where you've been.

## Sample 14  (category: commentary)
I still get goosebumps every time I hear it. You do too, don't you? Ah, I know you do.

## Sample 15  (category: commentary)
Oh boy do I relate to this one. Just me and the radio here by myself. Got nearly everything I love within arm's reach.

## Sample 16  (category: commentary)
No judgments here, friends. Let's call this one a cautionary tale about self-destructive behavior. I'm not telling you how to live your lives just trying to help you live your best ones.

## Sample 17  (category: other)
Oh, Cass, sweetie, raise your standards just a little bit. You're worth it.

## Sample 18  (category: other)
I just love that someone, somewhere decided the phrase bingle bangle bungle was worth using as a lyric. I hope it makes you smile, too.

## Sample 19  (category: other)
I can't be the only one who wants to see a duet with Mr. Two left hands here and Pigfoot Pete. Right. Who's with me?

## Sample 20  (category: other)
Do you think at any point those guys said, hey, this is a weird thing to write a song about. Because I wonder about it all the time.

## Sample 21  (category: song_intro)
Hey there. Would you like to weirdly feel happy and sad at the same time? Well, here's your chance. It's bubbles in my beer.

## Sample 22  (category: song_intro)
Oh, this next song was one of my mom's favorites. She'd get so excited every time it came on the radio. Without fail. Here's opus number one by Tommy Dorsey.

## Sample 23  (category: commentary)
It's true that there are people in the world who will let you down. But it should just make you appreciate the folks who are always there for you even more. Not everyone is a fair weather friend. You find the people who are there for you no matter what, and you stick together.

## Sample 24  (category: commentary)
Take a page from Billie Holiday and believe you can do the impossible. It can make all the difference.

## Sample 25  (category: song_outro)
That song is just so timeless. Feels like it's been around forever, doesn't it?

## Sample 26  (category: song_outro)
Did you crack open a Nuka Cola for that? I sure did. Also, I am running super low on Nuka Cola. Donations are appreciated.

## Sample 27  (category: other)
You know, it is hard to find ballistic fiber. Oh my gosh.

## Sample 28  (category: other)
Okay, everyone. Here it comes. Grab your pals, maybe a banjo and belt it out along with the radio. I know you've been waiting for this one.

## Sample 29  (category: other)
I hate to break it to you all, but if you see an orange colored sky, grab the radex and lots of it, because that ain't love out there.

## Sample 30  (category: other)
Remember, friends, you're not alone out there. The world is filled with people and you share the same goals with at least some of them. Take care of yourselves and each other.
