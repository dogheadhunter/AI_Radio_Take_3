Ain't Misbehavin' by Fats Waller

No one to talk with, all by myself
No one to walk with, but I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin'
Savin' my love for you
For you, for you, for you
I know for certain the one I love
I'm through with flirtin', it's you that I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin'
Savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner in the corner
Don't go nowhere, what do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for
Believe me
I don't stay out late, no place to go
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin'
Savin' all my love for you

I don't stay out late, got no place to go
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin'
Savin' my love for you
