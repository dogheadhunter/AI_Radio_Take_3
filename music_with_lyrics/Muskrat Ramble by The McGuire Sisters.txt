Muskrat Ramble by The McGuire Sisters

Shufflin, shufflin, shufflin down
Ramblin scramblin headin for town
Hustlin, bustlin buzzin around
Happily awaitin at the station

Look at that train number 709
It's a fuffin and a puffin and comin on time
Who do you think is about to arrive
It's the band they call the Dixieland Five

Da da da da dum
Da da da da dum
Da da da da da da da da dum

They're gonna play that muskrat ramble tune
You never heard it played, join in the big parade
Altogether now one and two join that happy throng
Feel the beat of that ramblin, scramblin musdrat song
Come on and ramble along

Loooooook at them a shufflin shufflin down
Ramblin scramblin headin for town
Hustlin, bustlin buzzin around
Happily awaitin at the station

Seeeee that 709
Huffin and puffin on time
Who do you think's about to arrive
The band they call the Dixieland Five

Da da da da dum
Da da da da dum
Da da da da da da da da dum

They're gonna play that muskrat ramble tune
You never heard it played, join in the big parade
Altogether now one and two join that happy throng
Feel the beat of that ramblin, scramblin musdrat song
Come on and ramble along
