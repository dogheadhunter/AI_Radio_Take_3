Keep That Coffee Hot by Scatman Crothers

Just keep that coffee hot (A-keep it hot)
Be sure you make a lot (A-make a lot)
Your coffee hits the spot (It hits the spot)
So keep that coffee hot (So keep it hot)
I love your coffee pot (I love your pot)
So keep that coffee hot (So keep it hot)
Just got my pay today (A-just today)
But I don't plan to stay (Ain't gonna stay)
I'm leaving right away (Yeah, right away)
Tonight's my night to play (My night to play)
I love your coffee pot (I love your pot)
So keep that coffee hot
Got some troubles to lose, gonna live down those blues, so goodbye
(Bye, bye, bye)
Gonna have me some fun until I see the sun in the sky
(Bye, bye, bye)
But whatever I do, I will come back to you by and by
(Bye, bye, bye)
