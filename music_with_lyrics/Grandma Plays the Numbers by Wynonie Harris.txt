Grandma Plays the Numbers by Wynonie Harris
============================================================

(Say, Wynonie, I was by your house last night and guess what happened)
(What happened, mon?)
(Your grandma was playing the numbers)
(Well you just finding that out?)
(Well what do you know, hmm?)

(We found out) Yes we did
(We found out) Now we know
(We found out) We found out that Grandma plays the numbers
(We found out) Yes we did
(We found out) She couldn't keep it hid
(We found out) Now we know that Grandma plays the numbers

Thinks about 'em everyday
Dreams about 'em every night
Gets up early in the morning
See all 'em numbers come down just right

(We found out) Yes we know
(We found out) Bless her soul
(We found out) Now we know that Grandma plays the numbers

(We found out) Yes we know
(We found out) Bless her soul
(We found out) Now we know that Grandma plays the numbers
(We found out) Yes, oh yes
(We found out) We found out
(We found out) Now we know that Grandma plays the numbers

She's at the fruit stand everyday
Buys bananas by the bunch
She looks at all the price tags
That's where she gets her hunch

(We found out) Yes we know
(We found out) Bless her soul
(We found out) Now we know that Grandma plays the numbers

(Hey, Grandma, did you get your numbers in yet?)
(Well, I 'spect I did, son)
(Well, what did you play?)
(Three, six, nine)
(Well, what do you know?)
