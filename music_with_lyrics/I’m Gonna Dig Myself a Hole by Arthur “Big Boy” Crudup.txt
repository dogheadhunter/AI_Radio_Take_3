I’m Gonna Dig Myself a Hole by Arthur “Big Boy” Crudup
============================================================

I might dig myself a hole
Move my baby down in the ground
I might dig myself a hole
Move my baby down in the ground
You know when I come out
There won't be no wars around
Well, I got my white canary, my class card, too
My baby's wondering Lord now what am I to do
Might dig myself a hole
Move my baby down in the ground
You know when I come out
There won't be no wars around
Yeah!
Well, they take me to the river front, cross the deep blue sea
My baby begin to wonder what in the world become of me
Dig myself a hole
Move my baby down in the ground
You know when I come out
There won't be no wars around
I'm might-a leave my baby all pulled up and crying
You know that's the reason why I 'm really gonna change my mind
Dig myself a hole
Move my baby down in the ground
You know when I come out
There won't be no wars around
Well, I ain't got no one to love me, all I got is gone
My baby leavin' me and I'm leavin' up my home
I might dig myself a hole
Move my baby down in the ground
You know when I come up
There won't be no wars around
