Three Cigarettes in an Ash Tray by Patsy Cline

Two cigarettes in an ashtray
My love and I in a small cafe
Then a stranger came along
And everything went wrong
Now there's three cigarettes in the ashtray (In the ashtray)
I watched her take him from me
And his love is no longer my own
Now they are gone and I sit alone
And watch one cigarette burn away
I watched her take him from me
And his love is no longer my own
Now they are gone and I sit alone
And watch one cigarette burn away
