Cigarettes and Coffee Blues by Lefty Frizzell

I guess I'll take a walk tonight, I know that I can't sleep
And I won't go to bed at all, I'd just lay there and weep
Instead, I'll make our favorite spot, that's what I think I'll do
I got those smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee blues
Smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee all night long
Wondering how a love so right could suddenly go wrong
I'd take the next bus out of town, but I got to be near you
I got those smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee blues

Sitting at the table, where I call baby's name
Wondering where our love went wrong, wondering who's to blame
Listening while the jukebox plays the songs that make me blue
Another cup of coffee and a cigarette or two
Smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee all night long
Wondering how a love so right could suddenly go wrong
There's a lot of other people know the misery I go through
I got those smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee blues
