Mairzy Doats by The Pied Pipers

Al Trace
Oh, mairzy doats and dozy doats and little lambsy divey
A kiddle divey, too. Wouldn't you?
Oh, mairzy doats and dozy doats and little lambsy divey
A kiddle divey, too. Wouldn't you?
If the words sound queer and funny to your ear,
A little bit jumbled and jivey.
Say, "Mares eat oats and does eat oats
and little lambs eat ivy."
Oh, mairzy doats and dozy doats and little lambsy divey
A kiddle divey, too. Wouldn't you?
Oh, mairzy doats and dozy doats and little lambsy divey
A kiddle divey, too. Wouldn't you?
