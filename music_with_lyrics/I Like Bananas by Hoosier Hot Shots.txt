I Like Bananas Because They Have No Bones by Hoosier Hot Shots

We don't like to whistle
Can't blow saxophones
We like bananas because they have no bones
I stood by the fruit store on the corner
Just to watch a funny looking man
And this is what he said
I heard every word
And I'll tell you so you understand
I don't like your peaches
They are full of stones
I like bananas because they have no bones
Don't give me tomatoes
Can't stand ice cream cones
I like bananas because they have no bones
No matter where I go with Susie, May, or Anna
I want the world to know
I must have my banana
Canned peaches and onions hurt my singing tones
I like bananas because they have no bones
We like bananas because they have no bones
