A Room With a View by Artie Shaw

A room with a view
I've got a room with a view
Of wonderful you, my next door dream
'Cause you're the one and only one my heart really adores
And I'm so glad my window pane
Is just opposite yours
It isn't the moon way up in heaven above
It isn't the stars I'm dreaming of
I'm only looking forward to the time that I'll be sharing with you
A heaven for two
A room with a view
