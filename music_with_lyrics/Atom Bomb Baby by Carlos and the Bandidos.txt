Atom Bomb Baby by Carlos & the Bandidos

Well I avoid my baby when I'm feelin' blue
'cause it ain't much fun, I'm a-tellin' you
If she's set to explode, you better duck and dive
You might be lucky to get out alive

She's my atom bomb baby
With my atom bomb heart
I loved that girl right from the start
She may be mad and a-evil too
But a-what more can I do?

Well, her hair is blonde, and her eye is green
It's when she hits a roof, (?)
But she clenches her fist, gets red in the face
And you end up and up a-deep in outer space

Shе's my atom bomb baby
With my atom bomb heart
I loved that girl right from the start
And whеn she kisses me, it's like a fire alarm
And I love her, Lord, oh Lord

Well, well we go for a walk underneath the moon
She starts a-rantin', crazy like a loon
I quickly hit the floor for a-after a while
She's a-detonatin' like a guided missile

She's my atom bomb baby
With my atom bomb heart
I loved that girl right from the start
And when she kisses me, it's like a fire alarm
And I love her, Lord, oh Lord

Well, my atom bomb baby needs a (?)
So I'm a-gonna take her home to meet my family
But I forgot to tell 'em 'bout her (?) fuse
I had to call Jim down into the rescue

She's my atom bomb baby
With my atom bomb heart
I loved that girl right from the start
But when she kisses me, it's like a fire alarm
And I love her, Lord, oh Lord
