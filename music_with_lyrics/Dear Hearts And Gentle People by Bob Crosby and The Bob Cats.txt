Dear Hearts And Gentle People by Bob Crosby & The Bob Cats

I love those dear hearts and gentle people
Who live in my home town
Because those dear hearts and gentle people
Will never ever let ya' down
They read the good book from fri till monday
Thats how the weekend goes
(Thats how it goes!)
I've got a dream house i'll build there one day
With picket fence and rambling road
I feel so welcome each time that i return
That my happy heart keeps laughin' like a clown
I love those dear hearts and gentle people
Who live n' love in my home town
They read the good book from fri till monday
Thats how the weekend goes
I've got a dream house I'll built there one day
With picket fence and rambling road
I feel so welcome each time that i return
That my happy heart keeps laughin' like a clown
I love those dear hearts and gentle people
Who live n' love in my home town
(In my home town!)
Those dear hearts and gentle people
Who live in my home town
