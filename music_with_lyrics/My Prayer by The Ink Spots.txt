My Prayer by The Ink Spots

My prayer is to linger with you
At the end of the day
In a dream that's devine
My prayer is a rapture in blue
With a world far away
And your lips close to mine
Tonight while our hearts are aglow
Oh tell me the words that I'm longing to know
My prayer and the answer you give
May they still be the same
For as long as we live
That you'll always be there
At the end of my prayer
My prayer is to linger with you
At the end of each day
In a dream that's devine
My prayer is a rapture in blue
With a world far away
And your lips close to mine
Tonight while our hearts are aglow
Oh tell me the words that I'm longing to know
My prayer and the answer you give
May they still be the same
For as long as we live
That you'll always be there
At the end of my prayer
