Butcher Pete by Roy Brown

Well, They Let Ole' Pete Outta' Jail
He Went Back To His Store
All The Women Who Played His Bail
Were Waitin' On Pete to Chop some More
He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'
He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'
He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'
He just hacks, wacks, choppin' that meat
There's an old woman, who's ninety-two
Lives down the street
She said, one thing more I wanna do
Is find ole' Pete and let him chop my meat
He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'
He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'
He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'
He just hacks, wacks, (Hey, now!) choppin' that meat
Pete went to church one Sunday night
He gave the preacher a fit
That crazy Pete started a fight
When he went hackin' on the pulpit
He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'
He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'
He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'
He just hacks, wacks, choppin' that meat
Well, they put him in jail again
They tried to give him life
Pete beat the case, he pleaded insane
They gave him back his same ole knife
He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'
He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'
He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'
He just hacks, wacks, choppin' that meat
Well, he got out of jail on Sunday night
Monday he tightened his grip
He started to China to see the sites
Went nuts again and chopped up the ship
He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'
He's hackin' and wackin' and (Hey, Now!) smackin'
He's hackin' and wackin' and (Mmmm!) smackin'
He just hacks, wacks, choppin' that meat
Brought ole Pete back to town
To electrocute him there
But Pete was crazy like a clown
He chopped down that electric chair
He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin' (He's A Maniac!)
He's hackin' and wackin' (He don't do nothin' but hackin') and smackin'
He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'
He just hacks, wacks, choppin' that meat
