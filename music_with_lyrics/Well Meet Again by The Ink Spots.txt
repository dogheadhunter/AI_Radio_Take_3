We'll Meet Again by The Ink Spots

We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day
Keep smiling through
Just like you always do
'Til the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away
So, will you please say hello to the folks that I know?
Tell them I won't be long
They'll be happy to know that as you saw me go
I was singing this song
We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day
Yeah, we'll meet again
I don't know where and I don't know when
But I do know that we'll meet again some sunny day
So honey, keep on smilin' through
Just like you always do
'Til the blue skies drive all the dark clouds far away
And will you please say hello to all the folks that I know?
And tell 'em that I won't be long
They'll be happy to know that as you saw me go
I was singin' this song
We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day
