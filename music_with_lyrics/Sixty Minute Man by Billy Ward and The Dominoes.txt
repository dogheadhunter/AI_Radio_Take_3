Sixty Minute Man by Billy Ward & The Dominoes

Sixty-minute man, sixty-minute man
Look a here girls, I'm telling you now
They call me "Lovin' Dan"
I rock 'em, roll 'em all night long
I'm a sixty-minute man (yeah, yeah)
If you don't believe I'm all that I say
Come up and take my hand
When I let you go you'll cry, "Oh yes"
"He's a sixty-minute man"
There'll be 15 minutes of kissing
Then you'll holler, "Please don't stop" (don't stop)
There'll be 15 minutes of teasing
And 15 minutes of squeezing
And 15 minutes of blowing my top
If your man ain't treating you right
Come up and see ol' Dan
I rock 'em, roll 'em all night long
I'm a sixty-minute man
Sixty-minute man
They call me Lovin' Dan
I rock 'em, roll 'em all night long
I'm a sixty-minute man
Sixty-minute man
They call me Lovin' Dan
I rock 'em, roll 'em all night long
I'm a sixty-minute man
There'll be 15 minutes of kissing
Then you'll holler, "Please don't stop" (don't stop)
There'll be 15 minutes of teasing
And 15 minutes of squeezing
And 15 minutes of blowing my top
If your man ain't treating you right
Come up and see ol' Dan
I rock 'em, roll 'em all night long
I'm a sixty-minute man, oh yeah
Sixty-minute man
