Was That the Human Thing to Do by The Boswell Sisters

Never thought that anyone in their right mind
Would ever treat another human so unkind
Didn't you sneak away and leave a note behind?
Was that the human thing to do?

Always thought that yours was such a heart of gold
But after I was sold on all the tales you told
Didn't you let your kisses turn from hot to cold?
Was that the human thing to do?

Now I'm not trying to patch things up
What's been done must be
Lord, I wouldn't even treat a pup
The way you treated me

How could anybody be so darned unfair?
You let me hang around till I learned to care
Didn't you even laugh and leave me cryin' there?
Was that the human thing to do?

To err is human, I heard you say
Forgiveness is divine
But all the sweet things that you may say
Can't mend this heart of mine

Never thought that anyone in their right mind
Could ever treat another human so unkind
Didn't you sneak away and leave a note behind?
Was that the human thing to do?

Always thought that yours was such a heart of gold
But after I was sold on all the tales you told
Didn't you let your kisses turn from hot to cold?
Was that the human thing to do?

Now I just want to be understood

Won't you tell me how could anybody be so darn unfair
You let me hang around till I learned to care
Didn't you even laugh and leave me cryin' there?
Was that the human thing to do?
Was that the human thing to do?
