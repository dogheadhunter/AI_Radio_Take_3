I'll Never Smile Again by The Platters

I'll never smile again
Until I smile at you
I'll never laugh again
What good, would it do?
For tears would fill my eyes
My heart would realize
That our romance is true

I'll never love again
I'm so in love with you
I'll never thrill again
To somebody new

Within my heart
I know I will never start to smile again
Until I smile at you
I'll never love again
I'm so in love with you

I'll never thrill again
To somebody new

Within my heart
I know I will never start to smile again
Until I smile at you
