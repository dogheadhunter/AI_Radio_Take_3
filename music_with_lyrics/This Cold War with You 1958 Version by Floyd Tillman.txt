This Cold War With You by Floyd Tillman

The sun goes down and leaves me sad and blue
The iron curtain falls on this cold war with you
Though you won't speak and I won't speak that's true
Two stubborn people with a cold war to go through
Oh why, oh, why should love ever come
To couples, like you and me
Whose cold, cold wars are never done
And whose hearts just can't be free
Oh let's do right or let's just say we're through
I just can't stand another cold, cold war with you
Oh why, oh, why should love ever come
To couples, like you and me
Whose cold, cold wars are never done
And whose hearts just can't be free
Now let's do right, or let's just say we're through
I just can't stand another cold, cold war with you
