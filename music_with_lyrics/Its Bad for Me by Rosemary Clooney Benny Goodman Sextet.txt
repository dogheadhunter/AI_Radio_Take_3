It's Bad for Me by Rosemary Clooney, Benny Goodman Sextet

Oh, it's bad for me, it's bad for me
This knowledge that you're going mad for me
I feel certain my friends would be glad for me
But it's bad for me
It's so good for you, so new for you
To see someone in such a stew for you
And when I say I'll do all you could for you
It's so good for you
It's bad for me
I felt 'til you whispered to me
Completely left on the shelf
But since you started to woo me
I'm just crazy about myself
It's a boon for you, a break for you
To hear that my heart's on the make for you
Yet no matter, however appealing
I still have a feeling it's bad for me

I felt 'til you whispered to me
Completely left on the shelf
But since you started to woo me
I'm just crazy about myself
It's a boon for you, a break for you
To hear that my heart's on the make for you
Yet no matter, however appealing
I still have a feeling it's bad for me
