Give Me the Simple Life by June Christy

I don't believe in frettin' and grievin'
Why mess around with strife?
I guess, I was cut out to step and strut out
Give me the simple life
It must be pleasant, dining on pheasant
Using the proper knife
I want tomatoes and mashed potatoes
Give me the simple life
A cottage small is all I'm after
One that's spacious and wide
A heart that rings with joy and laughter
With the ones you love inside
You take the high road, I'll take the low road
Free from the care and strife
Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeedy
Give me the simple life
Cottage small is all I'm after
Not one that's spacious and wide
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the one you love inside
You take the high road, I'll take the low road
Free from all care and strife
Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeedy
Give me the simple
