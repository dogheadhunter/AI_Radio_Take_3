Now, here's a story with quite a moral
And all you gals, you betta pay some mind

Because if you find a man worth keepin'
Be satisfied, make sure to treat him kind

Because a good man is hard to find
You'll always get the other kind
Just when you think that he's your pal
You turn around and find him messing 'round some other gal

And then you rave
You even crave
To see him laying right in his grave
So if your man is nice, take my advice

Hug him in the morning
Kiss him every night
Give him plenty lovin'
Treat him right
Because a good man nowadays is hard to find

You know, girls, once I had a man of my own, yeah
And since he's gone, boy, I really miss him
You see, most girls have to kiss a man to hold them
But me? Haha! I have to hold them to kiss them!

Oh, he wasn't much on looks or culture and he had a funny hand
As a matter of fact,
He wasn't much of anything but at least he was a man
And if he comes back to my little grass shack
I'm gonna hug him in the morning
Kiss him every night
Give him plenty lovin'
Treat him right
Because a good man nowadays is hard to find

Yessiree girls, they see that opportunity knocks but once
And when that once is gone, sister, it's gone forever
So girls, if you get a man, there's just one "but"
Keep a smile on your face and keep your big mouth shut (Hooray!)
I've learned my lesson now and everything's fine
And if he comes back I'll never, never step out of line
Because I know what to do when the day is through
Gonna hug him in the morning
Kiss him every night
Give him plenty lovin'
Treat him right
Because a good man nowadays is hard to find
