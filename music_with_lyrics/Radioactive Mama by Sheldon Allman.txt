Radioactive Mama by Sheldon Allman
============================================================

Radioactive mama, hold me tight
Radioactive mama, treat me right
Radioactive mama, we'll reach critical mass tonight

Well, when we get together, clear away the crowd
There won't nothing left except a mushroom shaped cloud

Radioactive mama, treat me right
Radioactive mama, we'll reach critical mass tonight

Well, your kisses do things to me in oh so many ways
I feel them going through me, all those gamma, gamma rays

Radioactive mama, treat me right
Radioactive mama, we'll reach critical mass tonight

Well since I kissed you baby that evening in the park
I lost my hair and eyebrows and my teeth shine in the dark

Radioactive mama, treat me right
Radioactive mama, we'll reach critical mass tonight
