Another Saturday Night (take) by Sam Cooke

"Rolling, 'Saturday Night', take eight"
"Here we go
One, two, three, four"
Another Saturday night
And I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now, how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way
Let me tell you 'bout it, lookie here
I got in town a month ago
I seen a lotta girls since then
If I could meet 'em I could get 'em
But as yet I haven't met 'em
That's why I'm in the shape I'm in
Here, another Saturday night
And I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now, how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way
Now, another fella told me
He had a sister who looked just fine
Instead of being my deliverance
She had a strange resemblance
To a cat named Frankenstein
Here, another Saturday night
And I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now, how I wish I had some chick to talk to
I'm in an awful way, yeah
Man, another Saturday night, ain't got nobody
If I'd've been back home now, I'd've been swinging
Two chicks on my arm
Lord, sad weekend
Let me tell you now, huh
It's hard on a fella
When he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey
To help me spend my money
I'm gonna have to blow this town
Here, another Saturday night
And I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now, how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful
Here it is, another Saturday night
And I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now, how I wish I had some chick to talk to
I'm in an awful
One more time, another Saturday night
And I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now, how I wish I had some chick to talk to
I'm in an awful
