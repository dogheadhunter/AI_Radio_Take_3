It’s a Most Unusual Day by Rosemary Clooney

It's a most unusual day
Feel like throwing my worries away
As an old native-born Californian would say
It's a most unusual day
There's a most unusual sky
Not a sign of a cloud passing by
And if I want to sing, throw my heart in the ring
It's a most unusual day
There are people meeting people
There is sunshine everywhere
There are people greeting people
And a feeling of spring in the air
It's a most unusual time
I keep feeling my temperature climb
If my heart won't behave in the usual way
Well, there's only one thing to say
It's a most unusual day
There are people meeting people
There is sunshine everywhere
There are people greeting people
And a feeling of spring makes your heart wanna sing
It's a most unusual time
I keep feeling my temperature climb
If my heart won't behave in the usual way
Well, there's only one thing to say
It's a most unusual, most unusual, most unusual day
