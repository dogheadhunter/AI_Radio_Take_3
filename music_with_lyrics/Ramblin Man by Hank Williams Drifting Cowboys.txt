Ramblin' Man by Hank Williams, Drifting Cowboys
============================================================

[Synced Lyrics - LRC Format]

[00:08.47] I can settle down and be doin' just fine
[00:17.43] 'Til I hear an old train rollin' down the line
[00:26.47] Then I hurry straight home and pack
[00:35.46] And if I didn't go, I believe I'd blow my stack
[00:44.72] I love you, baby
[00:49.20] But you gotta understand
[00:53.74] When the Lord made me
[00:58.23] He made a ramblin' man
[01:03.47] Some folks might say that I'm no good
[01:12.32] That I wouldn't settle down if I could
[01:21.04] But when that open road starts to callin' me
[01:30.14] There's somethin' o'er the hill that I gotta see
[01:39.53] Sometimes it's hard
[01:44.09] But you gotta understand
[01:48.79] When the Lord made me
[01:53.29] He made a ramblin' man
[01:58.16] I love to see the towns a-passin' by
[02:07.46] And to ride these rails 'neath God's blue sky
[02:16.54] Let me travel this land, from the mountains to the sea
[02:25.54] 'Cause that's the life I believe he meant for me
[02:35.25] And when I'm gone
[02:39.63] And at my grave you stand
[02:44.07] Just say God's called home your ramblin' man
[02:54.48]
