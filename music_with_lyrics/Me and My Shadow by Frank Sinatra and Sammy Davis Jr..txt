Me and My Shadow by Frank Sinatra & Sammy Davis Jr.

Like the wallpaper sticks to the wall
Like the seashore clings to the sea
Like you'll never get rid of your shadow
Frank, you'll never get rid of me
Let all the others fight and fuss
Whatever happens, we've got us.
Me and my shadow
We're closer than pages that stick in a book
We're closer than ripples that play in a brook
Strolling down the avenue
Wherever you find him, you'll find me, just look
Closer than a miser or the bloodhound's?
Me and my shadow
We're closer than smog when it clings to l.a.
We're closer than bobby is to j.f.k.
Not a soul can bust this team in two
We stick together like glue
And when it's sleeping time
That's when we rise
We start to swing
Swing to the skies
Our clocks don't chime
What a surprise
They ring-a-ding-ding!
Happy new year!
Me and my shadow
And now to repeat what I said at the start
They'll need a large crowbar to break us apart
We're alone but far from blue
Before we get finished, we'll make the town roar
We'll make all the late spots, and then a few more
We'll wind up at jilly's right after toot's shore
Life is gonna be we-wow-whee!
(here comes the party!)
For my shadow and me!
Say frank?
What is it, sam?
Do me a favor?
What do you want, now?
Would you mind taking it, just one more time?
From the top?
No! from the ending!
Wonderful!
And while we are swinging, to mention a few
We'll drop in at danny's, the little club too
But wind up at jilly's, whatever we do
Life is gonna be we-wow-whee!
(wow!)
For my shadow and me!
Frank?
Oh, forget it sam.
