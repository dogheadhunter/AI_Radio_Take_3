Bubbles In My Beer by Bob Wills
============================================================

Ah-ha-na
Yeah
Just watching the bubbles in my beer
But come in, Tommy
Give us the low-down on it
Tonight in a bar alone I'm sitting
Yes
Apart from the laughter and the cheer
That's not good
While scenes from the past rise before me
Yeah
Just watching the bubbles in my beer
A vision of someone who loved me
Brings a lone, silent tear to my eye
Ah
Oh, I know that my life's been a failure
Just watching the bubbles in my beer
Yeah
Alright
Ah-ho
Hot Tommy
I'm seeing the road that I've traveled
Yeah
A road paved with heartaches and tears
And I'm seeing the past that I've wasted
While watching the bubbles in my beer
As I think of the heart that I've broken
And all the golden chances that have passed me by
I was afraid that was what you coming to
And the dreams that I've made, now are empty
Ah now
As empty as the bubbles in my beer
