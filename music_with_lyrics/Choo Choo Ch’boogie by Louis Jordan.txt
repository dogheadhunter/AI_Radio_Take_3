Choo Choo Ch’boogie by Louis Jordan

Headin' for the station with a pack on my back
I'm tired of transportation in the back of a hack
I love to hear the rhythm of the clickety-clack
And hear the lonesome whistle, see the smoke from the stack
And pal around with democratic fellas named Mac
So take me right back to the track, Jack
Choo-choo, choo-choo ch'boogie
Woo-woo, woo-woo ch'boogie
Choo-choo, choo-choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack
You reach your destination, but alas and alack
You need some compensation to get back in the black
You take a morning paper from the top of the stack
And read the situations from the front to the back
The only job that's open needs a man with a knack
So put it right back in the rack, Jack
Choo-choo, choo-choo ch'boogie
Woo-woo, woo-woo ch'boogie
Choo-choo, choo-choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack
Gonna settle down by the railroad track
Live the life of Riley in the beaten down shack
So when I hear a whistle, I can peep through the crack
And watch the train a-rollin' when it's ballin' the jack
Well, I just love the rhythm of the clickety-clack
So take me right back to the track, Jack
Choo-choo, choo-choo ch'boogie
Woo-woo, woo-woo ch'boogie
Choo-choo, choo-choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack
Take me right back to the track, Jack
