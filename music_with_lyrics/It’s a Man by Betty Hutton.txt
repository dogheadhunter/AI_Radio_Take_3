It’s a Man by Betty Hutton

Girls! Girls!
Watch out! Watch out!
There's a two legged animal running about
If it smokes a great big cigar
And it hangs around at a bar
If it tells the biggest lies, wears the loudest ties
It's a man
If it acts just like a crossed patch
Has a face with whiskers that scratch
If it's stubborn as can be, mean and ornery
It's a man
It if walks, if it talks
If its habits are a little bit peculiar
If it brags and tries to make you think it's wonderful
Be on the lookout, don't let it fool ya
But if it makes the moon up on high,
More than just a light in the sky
If it kisses you and you find you like it too
GRAB IT! It's a man
If it whistles each time you pass,
Owns a car that runs out of gas,
Then it's that you get hip, better watch your step
It's a man
If it acts just like it's the boss
When it knows that you are, of course
If it gets a little rough, thinks it's very tough
It's a man
It if walks, if it talks
If its habits are a little bit peculiar
If it brags and tries to make you think it's wonderful
Be on the lookout, don't let it fool ya
But if it's kneelin' down on one knee
Sayin' darling please marry me
Then don't hesitate, better name the date and then
GRAB IT!
HOLD IT!
HANG ONTO IT! For It's a man
