I Still Feel the Same About You by Ella Fitzgerald & Ink Spots

I don't know how it happened
I don't know who's to blame
I dont know how I hurt you, but I hurt you just the same
And even though you say we're through
I still feel the same about you
Somebody must have told you the story that you've heard
That I have found another love but don't believe a word
And though you break my heart in two
I still feel the same about you
There's two sides to every story
As different as night and day
There's two sides to every story
Please hear what I have to say
No matter what has happened
No matter who's to blame
There'll never be another who can make me feel the same
So please believe that i've been true
I still feel the same about you
I feel the same, I still
I don't know how it happened, I don't know whos to blame
I dont know how I hurt you, but I hurt you just the same
And even though you say we're through
I still feel the same about you
Somebody must have told you the story that you've heard
That I have found another love but don't believe a word
And though you break my heart in two
I still feel the same about you
There's two sides to every story
As different as night and day
There's two sides to every story
Please hear what I have to say
No matter what has happened
No matter who's to blame
There'll never be another who can make me feel the same
So please believe that i've been true
And please feel the same about me
'Cause I still feel the same about you
End.
