Happy Times by Bob Crosby
============================================================

Wish on the moon
And look for the gold in a rainbow
And you'll find happy times

You'll hear a tune
That lives in the heart of a bluebird
And you'll find happy times

Though things may look very dark
Your dream is not in vain
For when do you find the rainbow?
Only after rain
So wish on the moon
And someday it may be tomorrow
You will suddenly hear chimes
And you'll have your happy, happy times

So wish on the moon
And someday it may be tomorrow
You will suddenly hear chimes
And you'll have your happy, happy times.
