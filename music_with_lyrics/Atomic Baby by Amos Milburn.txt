Atomic Baby by Amos Milburn

I love my baby, she makes me oh so blue
I love my baby, she makes me oh so blue
She keeps me so worried, that I call her U 92
She's got a high potential and a low resistance point
She's got a high potential and a low resistance point
I have to be so careful, that gal might blow up the joint
Yeah, she heats my room, she lights my light
She starts my motor and it runs all night
She's my atomic baby, yeah, she's my atomic baby
She's my atomic baby and I have to handle her with care
They can build them small, they can build them large
But they can't build a motor that will stand a charge
With my atomic baby, she's my atomic baby
She's my atomic baby and I have to handle her with care
Yeah, she's a little bitty mama who needs a whole lot of room
She's a little bitty mama that needs a whole lot of room
She can ignite your rockets and lead you onto the moon
