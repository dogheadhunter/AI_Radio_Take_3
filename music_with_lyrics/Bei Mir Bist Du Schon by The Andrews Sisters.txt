Bei Mir Bist Du Schon by The Andrews Sisters

Of all the boys I've known, and I've known some,
Until I first met you I was lonesome,
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me.
You're really swell I have to admit, you
Deserve expressions that really fit you,
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me.
Bei mir bist du schön, please let me explain,
"Bei mir bist du schön" means you're grand.
Bei mir bist du schön, again I'll explain,
It means you're the fairest in the land.
I could say "bella, bella", even say "wunderbar".
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are.
I've tried to explain "Bei mir bist du schön".
So kiss me and say you'll understand.
"Bei mir bist du schön", you've heard it all before

But let me try to explain
"Bei mir bist du schön" means that you're grand
Bei mir bist du schön, it's such an old refrain
And yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand
I could say "bella, bella", even say "wunderbar".
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are
I could say "bella, bella", even say "wunderbar".

Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are
I've tried to explain "Bei mir bist du schön".
So kiss me and say that you'll understand.
