Cuban Pete by Desi Arnaz
============================================================

They raved about Sloppy Joe
The Latin Lothario
But Havana has a new sensation
He's really a modest guy
Although he's the hottest guy in Havana
And here's what he has to say

They call me Cuban Pete
I'm the king of the rumba beat
When I play the maracas
I go chick chicky boom, chick chicky boom

Yes sir, I'm Cuban Pete
I'm the craze of my native street
When I start to dance everything goes chick chicky boom, chick chicky boom

The Senoritas they sing and how they swing with this rumbero
It's very nice, so full of spice
And when they're dancing they bring a happy ring, maraquero
Singing a song, all the day long

So if you like the beat
Take a lesson from Cuban Pete
And I'll teach you to chick chicky boom
Chick chicky boom, chick chicky boom

Si, Senorita I know that you will like the chicky boom chick
Cause it's the dance of Latin romance
And Cuban Pete doesn't teach you in a hurry like Arthur Murray
You're now in Havana and there's always mañana
So Senorita, please, take it easy, do it with ease
And you'll love it when you do the chick chick chicky boom
Chick chicky boom

Chick-chick-chick-chick-chicky boom
Chick chicky boom, chick chicky boom
