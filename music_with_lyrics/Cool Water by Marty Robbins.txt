Cool Water by Marty Robbins

All day I've faced a barren waste
Without the taste of water, cool water
Old Dan and I with throats burned dry
And souls that cry for water
Cool, clear water

The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water, cool water
And with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water
Cool, clear water

Keep a-movin', Dan, don't you listen to him, Dan
He's a devil, not a man
And he spreads the burnin' sand with water
Dan, can you see that big, green tree?
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waitin' there for you and me?
Water, cool, clear water

The shadows sway and seem to say
"Tonight we pray for water, cool water"
And way up there He'll hear our prayer
And show us where there's water
Cool, clear water

Keep a-movin', Dan, don't you listen to him, Dan
He's a devil, not a man
And he spreads the burnin' sand with water
Dan, can you see that big, green tree?
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waitin' there for you and me?
Water, cool, clear water

Cool, clear water
