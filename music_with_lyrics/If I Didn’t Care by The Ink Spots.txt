If I Didn’t Care by The Ink Spots
============================================================

If I didn't care, more than words can say
If I didn't care, would I feel this way?
If this isn't love then why do I thrill?
And what makes my head go round and round while my heart stand still?

If I didn't care, would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true, if I didn't care for you?

If I didn't care, honey child, more than words can say
If I didn't care, would I feel this way?
And Darlin', if this isn't love, then why do I thrill so much?
And what make my head go round and round while my heart just stand still so much?

If I didn't care, would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true, if I didn't care for you?
