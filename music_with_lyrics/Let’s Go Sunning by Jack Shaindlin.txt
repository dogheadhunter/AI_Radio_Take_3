Let’s Go Sunning by Jack Shaindlin

Let's go sunning
It's so good for you
Let's go sunning
Beneath the sky of blue
Greet the sun every morn
Feel as free and happy as the day you were born
Let's go native
Sun your cares away
Be creative
Learn to live and play
Pretty flowers need the sun
This applies to everyone
Life's worth living
When nature's giving
Happiness to everyone
So let's go sunning
Let's go native
Sun your cares away
Be creative
Learn to live and play
Pretty flowers need the sun
This applies to everyone
Life's worth living
When nature's giving
Happiness to everyone
So let's go sunning
