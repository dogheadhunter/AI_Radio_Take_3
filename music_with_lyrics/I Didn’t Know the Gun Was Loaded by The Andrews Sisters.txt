I Didn’t Know the Gun Was Loaded by The Andrews Sisters
============================================================

Oh Miss Effie was her name
Through the west she won her fame
Being handy with the gun
But she drove the men insane
'Cause she'd whip out her pistol
And shoot most any guy
And sing out this alibi
I didn't know the gun was loaded
And I'm so sorry, my friend
I didn't know the gun was loaded
And I'll never, never do it again
But one night she made a slip
Shot the sheriff in the hip
So the law, it took a hand
And made Effie take the stand
And she pled, "Oh, your honor I'll know you'll turn me loose When you hear my one excuse"
I didn't know (she didn't know) the gun was loaded
And I'm so (and I'm so) sorry, my friend
I didn't know (she didn't know) the gun was loaded
And I'll never, never do it again
I didn't know (she didn't know) the gun was loaded (that the gun was loaded)
But regarding the gun that I toted
All I did was hold it high
And go (ping)
I'll never, never do it again
Yes, the jury all agreed
That Miss Effie should be freed
But the sheriff's jealous wife was indignant (yes, indeed)
So she borrowed a pistol
And shot this village belle
And sang as Miss Effie fell
I didn't know the gun was loaded
And I'm so (and I'm so) sorry, my friend
I didn't know (she didn't know) the gun was loaded
And I'll never, never do it again
I didn't know (she didn't know) the gun was loaded (that the gun was loaded)
But regarding the gun that I toted
All I did was hold it high
And go (ping)
I'll never, never do it again
