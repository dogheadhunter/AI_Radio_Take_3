Walking the Floor Over You by Ernest Tubb

You left me and you went away
You said that you'd be back in just a day
You've broken your promise, and you left me here alone
I don't know why you did, dear, but I do know that you're gone
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink, that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
(Oh, pick it up, Steddy)

Now, darling, you know I love you well
Love you more than I can ever tell
I thought that you wanted me and always would be mine
But you went and left me here with troubles on my mind
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink, that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
(Oh, do it pretty, son)

Now, some day you may be lonesome, too
Walking the floor is good for you
Just keep right on walking, and it won't hurt you to cry
Remember that I love you, and I will the day I die
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink, that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
