Sway by Rosemary Clooney

When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me
Make me sway
Like the lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close
Sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me
Sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me
Sway with me
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I grow weak
I can hear the sound of violins
Long before
It begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth
Sway me now
Quien sera el que me quiere a mi
Quien sera
Quien sera
Quien sera el que me de su amor
Quien sera
Quien sera
I can hear the sound of violins
Long before
It begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth
Sway me now
Sway me smooth, Sway me now!
