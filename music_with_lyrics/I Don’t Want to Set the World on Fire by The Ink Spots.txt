I Don’t Want to Set the World on Fire by The Ink Spots

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart
In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you, no other will do
I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission, that you'd feel the same
I'll have reached the goal, I'm dreaming of, believe me
I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart
I don't wanna set the world on fire, honey
I love you too much
I just wanna start a great big flame down in your heart
You see, way down inside of me
Darling, I have only one desire
And that one desire is you
And I know, nobody else ain't gonna do
I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just wanna be the one you love
And with your admission, that you'd feel the same
I'll have reached the goal, I'm dreaming of, believe me
I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart
