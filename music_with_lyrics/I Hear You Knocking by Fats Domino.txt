I Hear You Knocking by Fats Domino
============================================================

You went away and left me long time ago
Now you come back and knockin' on my door

I hear you knockin'
But you can't come in
I hear you knockin'
Go back where you've been

I begged you not to go but you said goodbye
Now you come back tellin' all those lies

I hear you knockin'
But you can't come in
I hear you knockin'
Go back where you've been

If you had listened long time ago
You wouldn't be goin' from door to door

I hear you knockin'
But you can't come in
I hear you knockin'
Go back where you've been
