Orange Coloured Sky by Nat King Cole

I was walking along, minding my business
When out of the orange colored sky
Flash, bam, alakazam, Wonderful you came by
I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine
When out of that orange colored view
Flash, bam, alakazam, I got a look at you
One look and I yelled timber
Watch out for flying glass
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit, This is it, this is it
I was walking along minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Flash, bam, alakazam
Out of the orange colored sky
One look and I yelled timber
Watch out for flying glass
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit, This is it, this is it
I was walking along minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Flash, bam, alakazam
Out of the orange coloured, purple stripes
Pretty pink polka-dotted sky
Flash, bam, alakazam
And goodbye
