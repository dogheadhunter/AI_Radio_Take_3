I Can’t Get Started by Ella Fitzgerald
============================================================

I've flown around the world in a plane
I've settled revolutions in Spain
The North Pole I have charted
But can't get started with you

Around the golf course, I'm under par
And all the movies want me to star
I've got a house, a show place, but I get no
But I get no place with you

You're so supreme, lyrics I write of you
Scheme, just for a sight of you
Dream, both day and night, of you
And what good does it do?

I've been consulted by Mr. Beer
Morlin Brando has asked me to tea
But you've got me downhearted
'Cause I can't get started with you

When first we met
How you elated me pet
You devastated me, yet
Now you've deflated me
'Til you're my Waterloo

I've sold my kisses at a bazaar
And now after me, they've named a singer
But now I'm so downhearted
'Cause I can't get started with you

You rascal, you
