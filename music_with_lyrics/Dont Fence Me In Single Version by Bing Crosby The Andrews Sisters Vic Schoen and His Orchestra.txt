Don't Fence Me In - Single Version by Bing Crosby, The Andrews Sisters, Vic Schoen & His Orchestra

Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above
Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love
Don't fence me in
Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever, but I ask you please
Don't fence me in
Just turn me loose
Let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the Western skies
On my Cayuse let me wander over yonder
'Til I see the mountains rise
I want to ride to the ridge where the West commences
And gaze at the moon 'til I lose my senses
And I can't look at hovels and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in

Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies
Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide country that I love
Don't fence me in
Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please
Don't fence me in
Just turn me loose
Let me stride on my old saddle
Underneath the Western skies
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
On my Cayuse
Let me wander over yonder
'Til I see the mountains rise
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
I want to ride to the ridge where the West commences
And gaze at the moon 'til I lose my senses
And I can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in
No, Papa, don't you fence me in
