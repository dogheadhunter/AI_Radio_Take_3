- This project is scaffolded for quick Python development using pytest.
- To get started, create a venv, install requirements, and open the project in VS Code.
- Use the `Python: Debug Tests` launch configuration to run tests with the debugger.
- **Testing**: Use mock tests by default (`pytest` or `TEST_MODE=mock pytest`). Only run integration tests (`TEST_MODE=integration pytest`) when testing full end-to-end integration with real services (Ollama + TTS), and ask the user first before doing so. See `tests/TESTING_MODES.md` for full details on the dual testing system, `docs/TESTING_QUICK_REF.md` for quick reference, and `docs/MOCK_TESTING_SETUP.md` for implementation details.
- If a shell command isn't working as expected, confirm you're not inside the Python REPL (you'll see the `>>>` prompt). Exit the REPL with `exit()` or `quit()`, or use Ctrl+Z then Enter on Windows (Ctrl+D on macOS/Linux), then run the command in your terminal.
