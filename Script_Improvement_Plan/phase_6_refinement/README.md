# Phase 6: Testing & Refinement

## Phase Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Goal** | Test, refine, and generate full content library with quality assurance |
| **Duration** | 5-7 sessions |
| **Complexity** | High |
| **Dependencies** | Phases 1-5 complete |
| **Outputs** | Full content library, refinement log, quality validation |
| **Status** | ⬜ Not Started |

---

## Why This Phase Matters

This is the final phase where we:
1. **Test at scale** - Validate system with real workloads
2. **Refine quality** - Improve prompts and validators based on results
3. **Generate full library** - Create all content for production
4. **Handle failures** - Address scripts that don't pass
5. **Validate quality** - Human review confirms production readiness
