  "notes": "Script reads naturally and sounds like the voice samples. Era appropriateness is spot on with no modern slang or dates/years mentioned. The script is clean without any emoji, violations, or placeholders. A minor issue with natural flow as it may need a bit more variation in sentence structure."
