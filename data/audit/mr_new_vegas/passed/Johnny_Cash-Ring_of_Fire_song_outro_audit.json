  "notes": "Script flows well and maintains the desired tone and voice. Era appropriateness is spot on with no modern slang or dates/years mentioned. Character's voice is close to the reference samples but could be a bit more aligned. Natural flow is good, but there might be room for improvement in making it feel even more natural. Past tense usage is mostly appropriate, but some sentences use present tense. Overall, a well-done script."
