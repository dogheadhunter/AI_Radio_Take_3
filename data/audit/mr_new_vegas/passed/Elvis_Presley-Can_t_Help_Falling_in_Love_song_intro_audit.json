  "notes": "Script flows naturally and sounds like Mr. New Vegas. Era appropriateness is perfect as it uses 1950s language without any modern slang or dates/years mentioned. The script is clean with no emoji, meta-commentary, or placeholders present. It's just under the ideal length of 120 words and reads naturally. Lastly, it ends with the introduction of the song by mentioning its artist and title."
