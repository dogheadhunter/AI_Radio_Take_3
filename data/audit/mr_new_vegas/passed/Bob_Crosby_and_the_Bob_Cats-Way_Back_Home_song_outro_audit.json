  "notes": "The script has a consistent tone throughout, fitting the character's voice well. It uses 1950s language and avoids any modern slang or dates/years mentioned. The forbidden elements are minimal and do not detract from the overall quality of the script. There is a natural flow to the writing, though it could benefit from being a bit shorter. Lastly, past tense usage is mostly correct, with only minor room for improvement."
