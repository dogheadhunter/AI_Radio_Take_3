  "notes": "Overall, the script sounds authentic and engaging. The voice matches the character's description, and it uses past tense effectively. Era appropriateness is spot on, and there are no modern slang terms or date/time references. The natural flow of speech is mostly consistent, but it could be slightly improved for a more conversational feel. No emoji, meta-commentary, or placeholders were detected."
