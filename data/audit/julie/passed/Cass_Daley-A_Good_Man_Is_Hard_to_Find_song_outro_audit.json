  "notes": "The script is in Julie's voice and has a warm, hopeful tone. It uses appropriate modern American slang and avoids any anachronisms or references to the wrong era. There are no forbidden elements like emojis, dates, or TTS-breaking punctuation. The natural flow of the script is smooth and well-structured, using past tense as required."
