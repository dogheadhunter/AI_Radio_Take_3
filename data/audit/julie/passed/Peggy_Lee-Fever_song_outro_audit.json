  "notes": "Overall, the script is consistent with Julie's voice and sounds like the character. It uses language from the 1950s without any modern slang or dates/years mentioned. The script reads naturally, although it could be a bit shorter. Lastly, it uses past tense and doesn't start sentences with present tense."
