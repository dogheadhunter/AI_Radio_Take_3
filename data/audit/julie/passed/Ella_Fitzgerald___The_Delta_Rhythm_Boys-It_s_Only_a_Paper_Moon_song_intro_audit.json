    "script sounds slightly more formal than Julie's voice samples"

  "notes": "Script reads naturally and appropriately for the 1950s era. It has a good balance of forbidden elements and natural flow. The length is within the acceptable range, but it could be made to sound more like Julie in a few sentences."
