  "notes": "The script flows well and sounds like the provided voice samples. It uses appropriate language from the 1950s without any modern slang or dates/years mentioned. The script is clean with no emoji, meta-commentary, or placeholders present. The past tense usage is mostly correct, but it could be improved by avoiding the use of present tense in some instances."
