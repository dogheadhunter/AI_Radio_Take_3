  "notes": "Script sounds very much like the voice samples provided. The language used is appropriate for the era, and there are no forbidden elements or violations present. The flow reads naturally, but it could be a bit shorter. Past tense usage is generally correct, though there are a few instances of present tense that should be changed to past tense."
