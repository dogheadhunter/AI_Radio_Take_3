    "The script may be slightly too formal for Julie's voice."
  ],
  "notes": "Overall, the script is well-written and sounds like Julie. It uses appropriate language from the 1950s and doesn't mention any dates or years. There are no forbidden elements, and the natural flow is good. However, it could benefit from sounding a bit more relaxed and casual, like Julie's voice samples."
