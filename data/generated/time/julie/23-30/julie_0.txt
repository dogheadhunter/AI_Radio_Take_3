Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time to take a break from dancing and let the night sink in... but first, we've got a little announcement for you! It's that magical hour when the clock strikes eleven, or should I say, thirty? That's right, it's 11:30 PM here on Julie's dance floor! Keep those feet movin' and bodies groovin', folks! And remember, this is DJ Julie's show, so make sure you give her a round of applause for keeping the beats comin' all night long!
