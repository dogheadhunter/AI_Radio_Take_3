Ladies and gentlemen, let me take you on a journey through the night! As we edge closer to the witching hour, our fearless leader Julie has one more trick up her sleeve... or should I say, 10 tricks up her sleeves? That's right, folks, it's time for Julie's midnight extravaganza! So put on your dancing shoes and get ready to ride the groove train into the wee hours of the morning. It's DJ Julie's last show of the night at 10:00 PM sharp!
