Ladies and gents, let me paint you a picture - it's not quite noon yet, but we're getting closer! The clock is ticking, and I'm talking about 3:30 PM, my friends! That's right, the time when the sun starts to set and the party really begins. So get ready to dive into the deep end with mr_new_vegas - because that's where the magic happens!
