Ladies and gentlemen, we've got some chilly news for you this morning! The mercury has dipped all the way down to a frigid -11 degrees Fahrenheit, so keep those scarves snug around your necks. And don't even think about venturing outside without your warmest coat - it's as overcast as a classic Vegas lounge DJ can make you feel! Stay safe and stay cozy, listeners!
