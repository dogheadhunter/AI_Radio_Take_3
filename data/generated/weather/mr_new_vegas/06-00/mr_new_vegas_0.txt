Good morning, beautiful people! As the sun starts peeking over the horizon, we've got a delightful -13 degrees Fahrenheit out there right now. So, if you're heading out for your morning jog or that first cup of coffee, remember to bundle up against that cool breeze. But don't fret, folks; today's skies are partly cloudy, giving us just enough sunshine to brighten our day. Stay warm and keep that spring in your step!
