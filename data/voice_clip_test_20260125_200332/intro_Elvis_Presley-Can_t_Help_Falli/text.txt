As we ride the desert night, your love is like a warm ember that draws me near. And when our eyes meet under starlight, I feel my heart beat just for you. So let this serenade wash over us as it plays out from New Vegas to wherever your journey takes you tonight. Elvis Presley with Can't Help Falling in Love!
