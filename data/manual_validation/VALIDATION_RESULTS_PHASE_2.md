|------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| Nat King Cole - Mona Lisa | Hey folks, welcome back to the show! Today, we're going down memory lane with Nat King Cole and his classic hit 'Mona Lisa'. This tune is like a warm embrace; it's soothing, timeless, and just perfect for your afternoon. So, stick around, relax, and let the smooth sounds of this masterpiece take you on a journey. | **8** | Good warmth and conversational tone. Slight overuse of "stick around." Natural pacing. |
| Ella Fitzgerald - Dream a Little Dream of Me | Hey folks, I hope you're all enjoying this warm afternoon. Now, let's take a little trip down memory lane with Ella Fitzgerald and her classic hit 'Dream a Little Dream of Me.' This is the kind of tune that just makes you feel good from the inside out. So sit back, relax, and let the music wash over you. | **9** | Very Julie-like! Warm, inviting, and casual without being forced. "Feel good from the inside out" is perfect. |
| Frank Sinatra - Fly Me to the Moon | Hey folks, stick around — this next one might just brighten your afternoon. I'm talking about the timeless classic, 'Fly Me to the Moon,' performed by none other than Frank Sinatra himself. It's a song that always reminds me of summer drives with the windows down and a warm breeze in your hair. So sit back, relax, and let Old Blue Eyes take you on a journey to the moon and beyond. | **9** | Excellent! Personal memory ("summer drives") feels authentic. Good use of few-shot example line ("stick around — this next one..."). |
| Billie Holiday - God Bless the Child | Hey folks, I hope you're all doing well today! We've got a real treat for you this afternoon - one of my all-time favorites, 'God Bless the Child' by the legendary Billie Holiday. Stick around and let this soulful tune transport you to a warmer, more carefree time. Take it in and let the melody do the rest - enjoy! | **8** | Strong. Uses few-shot example ("Take it in and let the melody do the rest"). Slightly repetitive "stick around" across multiple intros. |
| Louis Armstrong - What a Wonderful World | Hey there, everyone! Louis Armstrong is coming up next with a classic tune that's sure to make your day just a little bit brighter. We're talking 'What a Wonderful World' here, folks! This song always takes me right back to sunny afternoons spent cruising down the highway. So stick around, and let the music wash over you. | **8** | Good energy and personal touch. "Cruising down the highway" fits Julie's vibe. "Stick around" used again. |
| Dean Martin - That's Amore | Hey there, folks! Are you ready for a little slice of Italian-American charm? I'm talking about Dean Martin's classic hit, 'That's Amore!' Let me just set the scene - imagine a warm summer evening, a twinkle in someone's eye, and this tune playing softly in the background. It's the perfect song to get your toes tapping and your heart smiling. So sit back, relax, and let the smooth sounds of Dean Martin take you away... | **9** | Excellent scene-setting. "Heart smiling" is a nice touch. Good length and warmth. |
| Tony Bennett - I Left My Heart in San Francisco | Hey folks, get ready to enjoy a classic tune that's always been close to my heart. I'm talking about Tony Bennett's 'I Left My Heart in San Francisco.' This song is like a warm embrace on a chilly day – just wait until you hear those familiar notes. It's the perfect pick-me-up for your afternoon, so stick around and let this beautiful melody take you away. | **8** | Good metaphor ("warm embrace on a chilly day"). Authentic and inviting. |
| Bing Crosby - White Christmas | Hey folks, turn that radio up a little higher! We've got a classic on our hands – the one and only Bing Crosby with 'White Christmas.' This song is like a warm hug from grandma, wrapped in an old-fashioned melody. Let's dive into this timeless treasure and make your day a little more jolly. | **9** | Charming! "Warm hug from grandma" is perfect for Julie's earnest, homey style. |
| Judy Garland - Over the Rainbow | Hey folks, let me just say this - we've got a real gem for you today! It's that timeless Judy Garland classic, 'Over the Rainbow,' and it never fails to brighten up even the cloudiest of days. So sit back, relax, and let the magic of her voice transport you somewhere over the rainbow blue. | **8** | Good enthusiasm. "Real gem" matches few-shot examples. Slightly awkward ending ("rainbow blue"). |
| Doris Day - Que Sera, Sera | Hey there, friends and neighbors! It's always a pleasure to share some wonderful tunes with you here on our little radio show. And today, I have a true classic that's sure to whisk you away to a time of carefree summer days. So sit back, relax, and let the magic of Doris Day's 'Que Sera, Sera' take you on an unforgettable journey. | **8** | Warm and friendly. "Friends and neighbors" fits well.

| Song | Generated Text | Score (1-10) | Notes |
|------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| Nat King Cole - Mona Lisa | Ladies and gentlemen, we're going way back tonight for a trip down memory lane with Nat King Cole. As you slip into your poodle skirts or don your tweed jackets, let the smooth sounds of 'Mona Lisa' carry you away to an era where romance was as effortless as breathing. So take a deep breath, sit back, and prepare to be swept off your feet by the sultry voice that is Mr. New Vegas. | **7** | Good theatrical opening. "Poodle skirts" and "tweed jackets" are period-appropriate but slightly heavy-handed. Self-referential ("Mr. New Vegas") is a bit odd. |
| Ella Fitzgerald - Dream a Little Dream of Me | Ladies and gentlemen, the enchanting Ella Fitzgerald is taking us on a journey with her dulcet tones in this timeless classic, 'Dream a Little Dream of Me'. As we glide through the smooth melodies that sweep across your ears, let romance fill the air and dreams take flight. So sit back, relax, and allow yourself to be swept off your feet by the sultry sounds of one of music's greatest icons. | **9** | Excellent! "Dulcet tones," "let romance fill the air" — perfect suave phrasing. Uses few-shot example ("swept off your feet"). |
| Frank Sinatra - Fly Me to the Moon | Ladies and gentlemen, settle in — this evening, we're taking a romantic journey to the moon with Frank Sinatra. As you glide across the celestial sea of sound, let the enchanting melody of 'Fly Me to the Moon' weave its spell around your hearts, dear listeners. Tonight, allow yourself to be swept away by the velvety smooth vocals of Ol' Blue Eyes, as he croons a timeless classic that'll have you dreaming in technicolor. So sit back, relax, and let's ride this musical rocket ship together, shall we? | **9** | Superb! "Celestial sea of sound," "dreaming in technicolor" — very poetic and theatrical. Uses few-shot ("settle in"). |
| Billie Holiday - God Bless the Child | Ladies and gentlemen, settle in — this one's a slow dance for the soul. We're taking you on a journey through the stars with none other than the incomparable Billie Holiday, as she serenades us with 'God Bless the Child.' So sit back, relax, and let your heart take flight with every tender note of her enchanting voice. | **10** | Perfect! Direct use of few-shot example ("settle in — this one's a slow dance for the soul"). Romantic, theatrical, no filler. |
| Louis Armstrong - What a Wonderful World | Ladies and gentlemen, gather 'round as we embark on a magical journey through the enchanting world of music. Tonight, I have the immense pleasure of presenting to you one of the greatest musical masterpieces of all time - 'What a Wonderful World' by none other than the inimitable Louis Armstrong. So sit back, relax, and prepare yourself for a symphony of sounds that will transport you to a realm where dreams take flight and love knows no bounds. | **8** | Good theatrical language. Perhaps slightly over-the-top ("greatest musical masterpieces of all time"). Still fits the character. |
| Dean Martin - That's Amore | Ladies and gentlemen, gather round — tonight, we're taking a leisurely stroll down memory lane with the one and only Dean Martin. As the lights grow low and the room falls quiet, let's cue up that timeless classic 'That's Amore' and lose ourselves in its smooth, romantic charm. For it's in these sweet, stolen moments of shared reverie that our hearts find their rhythm — a beat as old as time itself, yet forever young. | **9** | Beautifully written! "Stolen moments of shared reverie" is very Mr. New Vegas. Romantic and theatrical without being clunky. |
| Tony Bennett - I Left My Heart in San Francisco | Ladies and gentlemen, gather round as we embark on a journey to the city by the bay — San Francisco. It's where the heart of a man named Tony Bennett found its forever home. Today, I'm honored to share his timeless classic, 'I Left My Heart in San Francisco.' So sit back, relax, and let this musical love letter transport you to a time when romance was as smooth as silk and just as sweet as the city's legendary sourdough bread. | **8** | Good setup and romantic language. "Sourdough bread" is a slightly awkward detail but adds character. Overall smooth. |
| Bing Crosby - White Christmas | Ladies and gentlemen, gather 'round that glowing radio - it's time for a little bit of holiday magic with Bing Crosby. As he serenades us with his silky-smooth vocals, let the melancholy notes of 'White Christmas' wash over you like a gentle snowfall. This timeless classic is not just a song, but an invitation to escape into the warmth of the season and the comfort of loved ones near. So sit back, relax, and allow yourself to be whisked away by this enchanting yuletide delight. | **9** | Excellent! "Glowing radio," "gentle snowfall," "yuletide delight" — all very theatrical and romantic. Perfect tone. |
| Judy Garland - Over the Rainbow | Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to embark on a journey over the rainbow with the one and only Judy Garland. As her voice sweeps through the airwaves, let's take a moment to savor the magic of 'Over the Rainbow.' It's a song that transcends time and place, speaking to our hearts and souls in ways only the best music can. So, sit back, relax, and prepare for a musical adventure that will leave you spellbound. | **8** | Good theatrical intro. "Transcends time and place" fits well. Solid but not as vivid as some others. |
| Doris Day - Que Sera, Sera | Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we journey back in time to an era of romance and sophistication. As our beloved Doris Day serenades us with her timeless classic 'Que Sera, Sera,' let the smooth melodies of yesteryear transport you to a world where love was as sweet as moonlit whispers. So sit back, relax, and lose yourself in the enchanting sounds of a time when music told stories of hearts yearning for each other's tender embrace. | **9** | Beautiful!
