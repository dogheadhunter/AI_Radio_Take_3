1_julie,julie,Cass Daley,A Good Man Is Hard to Find,2,True,7.5,"Now we've got a tune that poses quite the question for us ladies out there - where do good men go, anyway? Here's Cass Daley with A Good Man is Hard to Find.",True,Good Julie voice - conversational rhetorical question fits her character. Natural bridge to song theme.
1_mr_new_vegas,mr_new_vegas,Cass Daley,A Good Man Is Hard to Find,1,True,8.5,"Ladies, let me ask you this: what makes a good man? With lyrics like these reminding us that it takes effort and patience in the search for true love - well then… I suppose he must be worth every second! Here's Cass Daley with A Good Man Is Hard to Find.",False,CRITICAL FLAW: Mr. NV asking rhetorical question breaks character. Should use declarative statements only. Also too wordy and rambling for his smooth persona.
2_julie,julie,Louis Armstrong,A Kiss to Build a Dream On,1,True,8.5,"Can you imagine dreaming up an entire life, just from one little kiss? That's what this song is all about. Here's Louis Armstrong with the soulful ballad - A Kiss to Build a Dream On.",True,Perfect Julie - rhetorical wondering fits character. Clean song intro. Good thematic connection.
2_mr_new_vegas,mr_new_vegas,Louis Armstrong,A Kiss to Build a Dream On,1,True,8.5,"Dreaming of the future, building on love and affection? Well then this next song is for you. Give me a kiss before I leave… or so goes one lyric in Louie Armstong's heartfelt ballad about cherishing every moment with that special someone. Here it is from us to all your loves out there - Louis Armstrong singing 'A Kiss To Build A Dream On'.",False,Opens with rhetorical question - breaks Mr. NV character. Too long (79 words). Misspells Armstrong as 'Armstong'. Needs tighter declarative opening.
3_julie,julie,Artie Shaw,A Room With a View,1,True,8.5,"Well, this next one makes me think about home and coziness. Who wouldn't want someone wonderful right outside your door? It feels like the perfect sentiment for after such an uncertain time out there in that post-war wasteland we've been living through. Here's Artie Shaw with A Room With a View.",True,Strong Julie voice - personal reflection and rhetorical question. Good wasteland context. Natural rambling style fits.
3_mr_new_vegas,mr_new_vegas,Artie Shaw,A Room With a View,1,True,8.5,"The sweet serenade of love and longing, courtesy of the great Artie Shaw. This next tune takes us on an intimate journey through windows to wonderful yous - our own secret dreams made flesh in someone special. Here is Master Swing himself with 'A Room With a View'.",False,"Too flowery and elaborate - 'dreams made flesh in someone special' is overly poetic. 'wonderful yous' is awkward phrasing. Loses Mr. NV's grounded smooth delivery."
4_julie,julie,The Ink Spots,Address Unknown,2,True,8.0,"I wonder if there are folks out in the wasteland listening to us right now, dreaming of those they've lost contact with. Maybe their address is unknown too. Here's hoping this song resonates with them - it's The Ink Spots performing 'Address Unknown'.",True,Excellent Julie - wondering tone and hopeful connection to listeners. Ties song theme to wasteland reality naturally.
4_mr_new_vegas,mr_new_vegas,The Ink Spots,Address Unknown,1,True,8.0,"The longing, the regret… this song says it all. What more can be said when you've been apart and your heart still yearns for that special someone? Here are The Ink Spots with their powerful plea of devotion - let me try to reach my love at …Address Unknown!",False,Rhetorical question again ('What more can be said'). Ending awkwardly trails off with '…Address Unknown!' - unclear phrasing. Should be declarative throughout.
5_julie,julie,Fats Waller,Ain't Misbehavin',1,True,8.0,"Folks, I gotta wonder - what did it mean to ""misbehave"" back when this tune was written? Wasn't life already a bit of chaos and upheaval after the war ended? Anyway, here is that playful piano man Fats Waller with Ain't Misbehavin'.",True,Classic Julie rambling - multiple questions and casual tangent about war context. 'Folks' and 'gotta wonder' are perfect voice markers.
5_mr_new_vegas,mr_new_vegas,Fats Waller,Ain't Misbehavin',1,True,8.0,"Ladies and gentlemen of the Mojave, get ready to kick your heels up high as I introduce a tune that embodies pure unadulterated joy! With its carefree spirit and playful lyrics about breaking all sorts of rules, this Fats Waller number is guaranteed to have you grinning from ear to ear. Here's Ain't Misbehavin' straight ahead for New Vegas tonight!",False,"Too long (68 words) and too enthusiastic/excited for Mr. NV. 'Get ready to kick your heels up high' and 'guaranteed to have you grinning' sounds like a carnival barker, not smooth lounge host. Too much energy."
6_julie,julie,Billie Holiday,All of Me,1,True,8.5,"I wonder if there isn't just something special about surrendering your whole heart, like what she does here in this ballad. It takes a certain kind of courage to be that vulnerable… Here is the incomparable Billie Holiday with 'All of me'.",True,Beautiful Julie reflection - wondering about vulnerability fits her character perfectly. Personal and thoughtful without being flowery.
6_mr_new_vegas,mr_new_vegas,Billie Holiday,All of Me,1,True,8.5,"In the spirit of love and vulnerability, I'd like to play something really special for you right now because giving all that we are is what makes life truly meaningful. Here's Billie Holiday with her iconic song about surrendering one's heart fully - take a listen as she pours out All of Me on Radio New Vegas tonight!",False,"Too long (59 words) and too philosophical - 'giving all that we are is what makes life truly meaningful' is preachy, not smooth. Mr. NV should be intimate, not lecturing on meaning of life."
7_julie,julie,Billie Holiday,All Or Nothing At All,1,True,8.5,"Billie Holiday sings about the extremes of love - either all in, or nothing at all. If that half-hearted stuff won't cut it for her heart… Here is Billie with ""All Or Nothing At All"".",True,Good Julie - conversational summary of song theme with trailing thought ('If that half-hearted stuff...'). Natural casual delivery.
7_mr_new_vegas,mr_new_vegas,Billie Holiday,All Or Nothing At All,1,True,8.5,"This song is a soulful, passionate plea for all or nothing - no half measures when it comes to love. It's the ultimate declaration of devotion and if your heart can't fully commit… well then maybe better not at all. Here's Billie Holiday with 'All Or Nothing At All'.",True,Strong declarative opening. Describes song effectively. 'Well then maybe better not at all' has good smooth delivery. One of better Mr. NV scripts.
8_julie,julie,Glenn Miller,American Patrol,1,True,8.5,"I wonder if folks out there in the radio wasteland, maybe some Vault dwellers tuning in on a stray signal, will recognize this familiar march. It was played at parades and patriotic events back when our country felt safer than it does now - but music has a way of bridging gaps between eras. Here's Glenn Miller with American Patrol.",True,Excellent Julie - wondering about listeners with tangent about past vs present. Rambling style fits. Good wasteland/Vault references.
8_mr_new_vegas,mr_new_vegas,Glenn Miller,American Patrol,1,True,9.0,"Glenn Miller's signature sound takes us on a nostalgic journey through the heart of America. Here, in his iconic arrangement ""American Patrol"", we find ourselves marching to an anthem celebrating our nation and its people. It's Glenn Miller with American Patrol!",True,Good Mr. NV - declarative throughout. Smooth description without being flowery. Appropriate patriotic tone for the march. Clean delivery.
9_julie,julie,Sam Cooke,Another Saturday Night (take),2,True,8.5,"I wonder if this song captures a scene many of us know all too well - another weekend night, dancing the blues away from life outside these walls. Here's Sam Cooke with that soulful take on ""Another Saturday Night"".",True,Good Julie wondering. 'Dancing the blues away' connects to wasteland context. Clean intro. Natural voice.
10_julie,julie,Cole Porter,Anything Goes,1,True,8.5,"Anything seems to be going in this tune, like it always has. Here's the one and only Cole Porter crooning anything goes!",True,Brief and casual - fits Julie. Simple intro works for upbeat song. Not overthinking it.
10_mr_new_vegas,mr_new_vegas,Cole Porter,Anything Goes,3,True,8.5,"Anything goes, they say - freedom reigns in every way! Here to prove it is the legendary songsmith himself, Mr. Cole Porter, crooning his iconic tune about breaking all social rules: anything truly does go when love takes over as he shows us with 'Cole Porter's Anything Goes'.",False,"Too wordy (52 words) and awkward phrasing. 'Anything truly does go when love takes over' - conflates song's playful social rebellion with romance theme that isn't central. 'Freedom reigns in every way' is generic. Needs tighter delivery."
