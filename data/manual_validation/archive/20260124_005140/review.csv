"5_mr_new_vegas","True","False","sounds more like julie not mr new vegas","Fats Waller, one of my all time favorites! He just made swinging jazz sound so effortless and fun. Now listen to him put that carefree spirit into every note on this lively tune called ""Ain't Misbehavin'"". This next song goes out from me straight through the speakers directly to you in your car cruising along Sunset Strip or wherever life takes ya tonight!"
"5_julie","True","True","pass","You know, Fats Waller had this certain swagger when he played the piano and sang. And I think that comes through in Ain't Misbehavin' there's a carefree attitude to these lyrics about not bothering with all those rules of propriety! So let loose for just three minutes as we hear from one of jazz's original rebels, Fats Waller himself singing 'Ain't Misbehavin'."
"4_mr_new_vegas","True","False","no dates of songs should be mentioned","The Ink Spots' harmonies are simply sublime, aren't they? Here now is a 1948 tune that will transport you to the war front and beyond it's ""Address Unknown"". Stay tuned for more heartfelt crooners on Radio New Vegas."
"2_julie","True","False","should thematically tie the intro into the song, end with the song introduction","Can you believe Louis Armstrong was already singing in his teenage years when he recorded A Kiss to Build a Dream On? His smooth, gravelly voice is just mesmerizing here. Now that's some dreamy vocals right there! What do y'all think does this sweet serenade evoke those tender moments from our own love stories. or maybe it reminds you of the ones we've lost in these troubled times out on the wasteland?"
"1_julie","True","False","almost good, but it should have ended with the song, the bit after it could be an additional commentary after the song plays","Well, if Cass Daley is telling us that good men are hard to find nowadays. maybe we should be grateful for those steady types still hanging around out there! Here's A Good Man Is Hard to Find. I'm curious do you think this song came about as a warning or simply an observation of modern life?"
"3_mr_new_vegas","True","True","pass","Ladies and gentlemen of New Vegas, it seems Artie Shaw has a very particular view indeed. In this jazz masterpiece called A Room With a View, he serenades us about the enchantment found when two souls connect intimately perhaps in that most romantic setting where hearts bare their deepest desires."
"1_mr_new_vegas","True","False","too long and should end with song introduction","Ladies and gentlemen of New Vegas, it seems our dear Cass Daley has a tale to tell in this next number. ""A Good Man Is Hard To Find"" certainly rings true for many out here in the Mojave Wasteland but I wonder if you're holding onto hope that someday he'll ride into camp? This song goes out from me straight to all your hearts longing tonight, reminding us love can still bloom even amidst radioactivity and raiders. Stay beautiful under those stars!"
"2_mr_new_vegas","True","True","perfect","Ladies and gentlemen, we've got some smooth jazz to set the mood tonight as Louis Armstrong croons out his dreamy ballad. A Kiss To Build a Dream On is all about holding onto hope for that special someone will you find your own 'dream kiss'? Let's listen in."
"3_julie","True","False","too wordy, and flowery in language, julie should be more grounded","Artie Shaw, that inimitable clarinetist and bandleader of the big bands. Here he is now introducing us to a tune with quite an evocative title A Room With a View. This one seems tailor made for those who still hold out hope about finding some semblance of domestic tranquility amidst these uncertain times, even when venturing back into that treacherous wasteland outside our little Appalachian Radio bubble."
"4_julie","False","False","too flowery in language, Julie should be more grounded, and too long, also should end with the song introduction","The Ink Spots bring us this touching, melancholic tune about lost love and longing in Address Unknown. The harmonies are as rich and velvety smooth as ever those signature ""doo wop"" choruses still send shivers down my spine after all these years of listening to 'em on the radio out here amidst the wasteland where civilization ended, wondering what became of people like you tuning in from Vault cities."
