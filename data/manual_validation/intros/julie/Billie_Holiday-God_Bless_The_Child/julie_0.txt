Hey folks, I hope you're all doing well today! We've got a real treat for you this afternoon - one of my all-time favorites, 'God Bless the Child' by the legendary Billie Holiday. Stick around and let this soulful tune transport you to a warmer, more carefree time. Take it in and let the melody do the rest - enjoy!
