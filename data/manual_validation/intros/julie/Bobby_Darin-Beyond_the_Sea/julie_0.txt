Hey, folks! Let me set the mood for you real quick with this little intro. Picture a sunny day at the beach - the sand between your toes, the waves lapping at the shore. Now imagine that feeling amplified by one of those classic Bobby Darin tunes that just make everything feel a little bit more magical. That's what 'Beyond the Sea' is all about - taking the good times and making them even better. So sit back, relax, and let the music take you on a journey beyond the sea.
