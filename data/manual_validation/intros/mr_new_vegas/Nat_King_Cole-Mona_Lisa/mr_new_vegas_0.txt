Ladies and gentlemen, we're going way back tonight for a trip down memory lane with Nat King Cole. As you slip into your poodle skirts or don your tweed jackets, let the smooth sounds of 'Mona Lisa' carry you away to an era where romance was as effortless as breathing. So take a deep breath, sit back, and prepare to be swept off your feet by the sultry voice that is Mr. New Vegas.
