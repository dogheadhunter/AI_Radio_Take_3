Ladies and gentlemen, we have a night of timeless tunes ahead of us. Let's kick things off with the inimitable Sam Cooke, serenading us with 'Cupid.' It's a romantic ballad that'll make you sway, even if you're sitting still. So, my dear listeners, let love blossom as Mr. Cooke croons his soulful melody.
