Sweetheart, in this song I think Louis is expressing the deep longing and hope that goes into building something special with someone you love. He sings of dreams taking shape under just one gentle kiss it gets me every time. And now from Radio New Vegas comes none other than Satchmo himself to serenade us: It's Louis Armstrong singing 'A Kiss to Build a Dream On'.
