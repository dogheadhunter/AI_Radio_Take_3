I don't know about you, but this song always makes me think of those late night conversations when everything feels right with the world. You're sitting close together on that creaky porch swing and it just seems like nothing bad could ever happen. Louis Armstrong is here to serenade us all tonight as he croons A Kiss to Build a Dream On, so get cozy!
