Crisp desert mornings are always a delight, ladies and gentlemen. Skies are partly cloudy today, with just a hint of haze perfect for gazing out at the majestic beauty of the Mojave Wasteland stretching endlessly to the horizon. A chance of afternoon showers is on the forecast, so be sure to pack those sun hats and ponchos.
