Just me and the radio here, wrapping up another song. That was Nat King Cole with 'Orange Coloured Sky', a classic tune that always brightens my evening. Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did something about his smooth voice just lifts your spirits, doesn't it? Well, time to move on to the next one. Here's Ella Fitzgerald!
