Wonderful choice, friends! That was Frank Sinatra singing "Yesterday," a timeless tune that takes me back to balmy summer nights spent listening to the radio with family. Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did always loved Ol' Blue Eyes. Next up, let's keep on groovin' with. The Drifters and "There Goes My Baby"!
