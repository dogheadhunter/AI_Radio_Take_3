Fever by Peggy Lee What a sultry, smoky set that was, friends! I think we're all still feeling the heat. That Peggy Lee, she sure knows how to get you in the mood with her husky tone and sassy delivery. Hope you enjoyed every sultry second of it as much as I did. Onward now to another classic tune for your evening.
