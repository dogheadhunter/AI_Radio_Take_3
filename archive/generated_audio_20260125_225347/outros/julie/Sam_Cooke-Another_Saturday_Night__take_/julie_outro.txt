Another Saturday night, indeed! That soulful voice of Sam Cooke always seems to capture the essence of a weekend evening, don't you think? Hope you enjoyed that classic tune as much as I did. We're winding down now, but stay tuned for more great music to keep you company on this lazy eve. Up next. The Platters!
