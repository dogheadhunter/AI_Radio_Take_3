Hope that sweet serenade from Louis Armstrong sent a shiver down your spine, friends. That gentle saxophone just whispered promises of love in my ear too. Now, I'm thinking about all those couples out there tonight, maybe under a moonlit balcony or in some cozy parlor. Wondering what dreams they're building together as the night unfolds? Well, here's to you and your sweet someone may every kiss be the stuff of legend! "A Kiss to Build a Dream On" by Louis Armstrong.
