Hope you're humming along with us still, friends! That "Me and My Shadow" duet really brought a smile to my face. Frank and Sammy's harmonies are just magic together I always feel a little less alone when they sing about that shadow staying right by your side through thick and thin. And the way their voices play off each other is pure joy, don't you think? Well, it's time for us to move on, but I'll leave you with that golden oldie playing softly in the background as we transition to our next selection.
