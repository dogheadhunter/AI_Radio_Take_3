Hope that got your feet tappin'! That "Mighty Mighty Man" by Roy Brown always gets me in the mood for a Saturday night out on the town, dancin' with friends under them twinklin' lights. Just me and the radio here, wrapping up another song. Well, hope you enjoyed that one as much as I did, folks! Up next, we've got some rhythm & blues from Big Joe Turner.
