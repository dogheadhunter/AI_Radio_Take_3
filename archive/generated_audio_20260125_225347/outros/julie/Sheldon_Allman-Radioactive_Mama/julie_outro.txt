Wow, that "Radioactive Mama" by Sheldon Allman really lit up the room, didn't it? That wild, wailing vocal just seemed to pull you in. I've always loved how this tune blends folk and doo wop it's like a slice of Americana wrapped in a mysterious blanket. Well, hope you enjoyed that one as much as I did!
