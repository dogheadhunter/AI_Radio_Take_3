What a lovely, lulling tune to float us away into a blue dreamscape. That was Joséphine Baker singing 'Blue Skies', her velvety voice like a warm breeze on a summer's day. Hope you enjoyed that peaceful escape as much as I did here, just me and the radio wrapping up another song together. Now let's see what other treasures are waiting for us on this musical journey. Here's Nat King Cole with 'Unforgettable'.
