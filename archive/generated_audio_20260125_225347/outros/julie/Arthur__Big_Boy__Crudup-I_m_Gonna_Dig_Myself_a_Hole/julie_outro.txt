That was Arthur "Big Boy" Crudup's bluesy 'I'm Gonna Dig Myself a Hole', friends. Just me and the radio here, reflecting on those heartfelt laments of hard times. Always resonated with me how he poured his soul into every strum of that guitar. Here's some more music to soothe your spirit it's Bill Monroe and his Blue Grass Boys, performing 'Molly & Tenbrooks'.
