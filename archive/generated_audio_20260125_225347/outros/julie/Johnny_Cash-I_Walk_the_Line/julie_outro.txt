Here's Johnny Cash bringing a sense of longing to our airwaves with "I Walk the Line". That was his debut single from way back in '55, and it still holds up today as a timeless tale of devotion. Hope you enjoyed this country classic as much as I did we'll keep the good tunes coming right here on the show.
