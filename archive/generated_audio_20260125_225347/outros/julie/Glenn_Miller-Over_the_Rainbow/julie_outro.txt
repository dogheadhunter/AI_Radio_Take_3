What a classic! That was Glenn Miller's take on "Over the Rainbow" just now, folks. Always loved that soaring melody it makes me imagine a world far beyond our troubles, where dreams really do come true over some magical rainbow. Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did here in my little radio nest tonight. Next up, we have something new from a young crooner named Bing Crosby, so stay with us!
