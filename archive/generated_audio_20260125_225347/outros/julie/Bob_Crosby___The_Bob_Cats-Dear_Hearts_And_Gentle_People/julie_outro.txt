Just me and the radio here, wrapping up another song that always feels like a warm hug. "Dear Hearts And Gentle People" by Bob Crosby & The Bob Cats had me humming along, remembering simpler times when life seemed less complicated. Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did let's keep savoring these comforting melodies together.
