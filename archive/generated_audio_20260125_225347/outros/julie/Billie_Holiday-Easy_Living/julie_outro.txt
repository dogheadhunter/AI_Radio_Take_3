Oh, what a smooth and sultry set we just wrapped up with Billie Holiday's 'Easy Living'. That velvety voice of hers never fails to make me feel like I'm in on some secret that only she knows. Hope you enjoyed that one as much as I did there's something so effortlessly cool about her delivery, don't you think? It's Nina Simone now for our next tune.
