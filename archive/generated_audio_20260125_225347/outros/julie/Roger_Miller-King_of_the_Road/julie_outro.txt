Here's my attempt at a warm, conversational outro for "King of the Road" by Roger Miller: That was quite the swaggering tune, friends! Hope you enjoyed riding along with ol' Roger as much as I did. Just me and the radio here, wrapping up another song that really put me in mind of carefree days on the open road. Well, hope you liked that one as much as I did. It's always a treat to share some classic country with you all out there, wherever you may be tonight.
