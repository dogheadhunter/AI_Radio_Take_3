Oh, what a soulful tune by Nat King Cole there. That melancholy longing in his voice just pulled me right in, wondering what heartache might be behind those words "I don't want to see tomorrow". Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did here's the incomparable Dean Martin for our next set: 'Ain't That a Kick in the Head'.
