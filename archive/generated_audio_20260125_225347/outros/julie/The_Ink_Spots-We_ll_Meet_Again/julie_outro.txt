Well, that was a lovely trip down memory lane with The Ink Spots. Their smooth harmonies always seem to fill the room with warmth, don't they? 'We'll Meet Again' is such a classic tune that never fails to lift my spirits and make me feel hopeful for what's yet to come. It's just beautiful. We'll Meet Again by The Ink Spots
