That was a real classic from Eddy Arnold, friends. Hope his smooth crooning on "It's a Sin" brought a little nostalgic comfort your way tonight. Just me and the radio here, wrapping up another tune as the evening wears on. Well, I think that about covers it for now. Stay warm out there and rest easy under the stars.
