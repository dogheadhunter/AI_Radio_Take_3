I love the romantic yearning in Bobby Darin's voice on "Dream Lover". Always makes me imagine slow dancing under twinkling lights. Hope that lovely melody and his smooth tone helped you escape for a moment too! That was "Dream Lover" by Bobby Darin thanks for sharing this nostalgic listen with me, friends.
