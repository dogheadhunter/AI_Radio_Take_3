Just me and the radio here, wrapping up another haunting tune. That Floyd Tillman's voice sure sends shivers down my spine, doesn't it? Like standing in a cold winter breeze when the wind picks up. 'This Cold War With You' was the perfect fit for this somber evening on the airwaves. Hope you enjoyed the melancholy as much as I did.
