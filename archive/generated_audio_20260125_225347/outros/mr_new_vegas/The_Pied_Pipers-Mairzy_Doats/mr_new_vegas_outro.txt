What a delightful tune to round out our set, ladies and gentlemen! That was 'Mairzy Doats' by The Pied Pipers. I hope you enjoyed their whimsical rendition as much as I did, singing along to those merry lyrics under the golden glow of New Vegas. Until next time on Radio New Vegas, it's been a pleasure sharing the sounds of this captivating city with you all until we meet again!
