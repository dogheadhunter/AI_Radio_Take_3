What a timeless classic, ladies and gentlemen! That velvety voice of Ol' Blue Eyes still gives me goosebumps. Frank Sinatra's smooth delivery had you wrapped up tight from the first note to the last, didn't it? I hope that brought a smile to your face out there in New Vegas. Until next time, stay tuned for more golden oldies!
