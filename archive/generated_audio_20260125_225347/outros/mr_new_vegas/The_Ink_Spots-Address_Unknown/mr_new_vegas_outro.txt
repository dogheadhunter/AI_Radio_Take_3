Thank you for tuning in, New Vegas. That was "Address Unknown" by The Ink Spots, a romantic tune that takes us back to an era of love letters and longing hearts. I hope it transported you to another time and place, even if your own address is unknown. Until next time, when we'll have more classic hits for you, this is mr_new_vegas signing off from Radio New Vegas, wishing you all the best under our desert skies.
