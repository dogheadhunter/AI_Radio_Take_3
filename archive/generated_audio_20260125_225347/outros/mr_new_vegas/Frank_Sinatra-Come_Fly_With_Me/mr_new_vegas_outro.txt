What a swingin' tune that was, folks! Frank Sinatra's smooth croon on "Come Fly With Me" had me feeling like I was taking to the skies with him. The way he wraps those velvety vocals around each lyric. well, it's simply sublime. Hope that brought a smile to your face out there in the Mojave as the sun sets over New Vegas. Until next time, darlings!
