And that was Frank Sinatra, crooning "If I Had You" for you tonight here on Radio New Vegas. Hope that took your mind off the desert heat for a moment, ladies and gentlemen. Until next time, when the stars align just right and our speakers fill with the best tunes from the Mojave, it's your DJ signing off this is Mr. New Vegas, wishing you always had love in your heart. and on your radio!
