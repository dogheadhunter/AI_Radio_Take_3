The one and only Ol' Blue Eyes himself, Frank Sinatra. That was "My Kind of Town," New Vegas. A classic, don't you think? The way he croons about Chicago's charms it's like a warm hug for your soul. Hope that brought a smile to your face as the sun sets over the Mojave. Until next time, stay perfectly you.
