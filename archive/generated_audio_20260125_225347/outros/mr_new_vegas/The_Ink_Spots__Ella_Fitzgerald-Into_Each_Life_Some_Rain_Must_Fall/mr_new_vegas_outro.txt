What a delightful duet from The Ink Spots and Ella Fitzgerald there, wasn't it? That timeless classic always brings a touch of serenity to our desert oasis here in New Vegas. And with that smooth harmony, I hope you found your worries drifting away like the final notes. Until next time, stay sweet as the Mojave sunsets.
