Well, that Roy Brown sure did bring some high energy to your evening! That mighty, mighty man had us all moving to his rhythm. And now, as we bid adieu to this rockin' tune, I hope you're feeling just as alive and ready for whatever the Mojave night may hold. Until next time on Radio New Vegas, darlings stay groovy!
