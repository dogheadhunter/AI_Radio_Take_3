And that sultry, timeless classic by Billie Holiday wrapped up for us here on Radio New Vegas. That was 'All of Me', a tune that never fails to transport me back to some sweltering desert night, where nothing matters but two souls entwined under the stars. Hope it brought you as much nostalgic longing as it did me out there in the Mojave. Until next time, ladies and gentlemen.
