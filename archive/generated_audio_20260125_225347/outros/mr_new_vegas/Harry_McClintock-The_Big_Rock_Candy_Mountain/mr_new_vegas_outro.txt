What a delightful journey that tune took us on! The lyrics painted such an enchanting picture of a sweet tooth's paradise. And now, as the final notes fade away, I hope you enjoyed that whimsical trip to The Big Rock Candy Mountain with me here at Radio New Vegas. Until next time, dear listeners, stay sweet and keep those ears open for more wonderful tunes!
