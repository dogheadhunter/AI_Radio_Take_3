And that, my friends, was Johnny Cash's iconic "Man in Black". That powerful tune spoke straight to our souls with its themes of justice, rebellion, and standing up for what's right. Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did Johnny's voice still sends chills down the spine all these years later. Until next time on Radio New Vegas!
