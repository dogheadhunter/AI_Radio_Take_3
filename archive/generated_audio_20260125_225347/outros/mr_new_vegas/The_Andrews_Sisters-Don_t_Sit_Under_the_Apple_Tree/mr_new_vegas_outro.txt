What a delightful classic, ladies and gentlemen! That was "Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree" by The Andrews Sisters, sending you off into the warm Mojave evening with its playful, lighthearted charm. Hope that brought a smile to your face as you remember those carefree days of youthful love. Until next time on Radio New Vegas. it's Dean Martin with "Ain't That a Kick in the Head".
