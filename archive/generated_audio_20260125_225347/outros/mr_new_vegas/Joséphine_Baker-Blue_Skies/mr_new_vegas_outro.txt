As Joséphine Baker's enchanting rendition of "Blue Skies" faded away, I couldn't help but feel a pang of longing in that melodic mist. That was an intimate performance, New Vegas almost as if we were strolling hand in hand under a cloudless desert sky, when all the stars aligned just right for romance. Until next time, sweet dreamers, stay enchanted.
