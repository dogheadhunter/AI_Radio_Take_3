What a marvelous match of voices we just heard, ladies and gentlemen! Ella's sparkling soprano and Louis' gravelly growl blended in perfect harmony. That was 'Let's Call The Whole Thing Off', a timeless classic from the golden age of jazz. Hope that spirited duet put a little extra spring in your step as you dance under the desert stars tonight. Until next time, New Vegas!
