What a soulful tune, ladies and gentlemen! That was "Grandma Plays the Numbers" by Wynonie Harris, bringing us that good ol' rhythm & blues flavor straight from the heart of New Vegas. Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did while spinning it for ya tonight under the neon lights of our desert city. Until next time, stay tuned to Radio New Vegas!
