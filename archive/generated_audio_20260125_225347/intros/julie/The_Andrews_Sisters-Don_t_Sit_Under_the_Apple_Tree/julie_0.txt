I'm curious does this song remind you of a summer day, maybe at a family picnic or church social? That upbeat tempo and cheerful lyrics certainly have that carefree feel. Here are The Andrews Sisters with their catchy tune about romance under an apple tree! Don’t Sit Under the Apple Tree by those delightful sisters from way back when – enjoy!
