I love how this duet between Ella and Louie captures the playful push and pull of relationships. They're almost arguing about whether they should stay together but it all sounds like sweet musical banter to me! Here's that lively debate, 'Let’s Call the Whole Thing Off' by Ella Fitzgerald with Louis Armstrong.
