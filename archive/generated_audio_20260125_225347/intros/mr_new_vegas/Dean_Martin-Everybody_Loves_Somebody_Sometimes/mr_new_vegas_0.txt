New Vegas, I've got a song for you that'll make your heart ache in the best way possible. It speaks to us all who hasn't known love and lost it? Who doesn't sometimes wonder if they're truly loved back? Here's Dean Martin with everybody loves somebody sometime. let this melancholy melody wash over you now, New Vegas.
