Ladies and gentlemen of the Mojave, I'd like to introduce you all to a fellow who really knows how to croon about that special kind of woman one who lights up your life with her presence. And speaking of lighting things up, just imagine this song's title: Radioactive Mama! That alone should tell us what kind of fiery passion is in store for our ears tonight. Here he comes now, the man behind those sultry vocals and a tune that'll make you sway like sand dunes under an arid desert breeze Sheldon Allman with 'Radioactive Mama'!
