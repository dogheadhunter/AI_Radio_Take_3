We've got a real treat for you tonight folks! I'm wondering what inspired the writers to pen lyrics about discovering primitive tribes in far off lands. But whatever their muse was, it's resulted in this catchy tune that has us tapping our toes and singing along. So let me play Civilization Single Version for you from Danny Kaye, The Andrews Sisters, Vic Schoen & His Orchestra tonight!
