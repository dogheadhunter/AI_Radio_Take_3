Ladies and gentlemen of New Vegas, let me paint a picture for you it's late at night in the Mojave desert under an endless starry sky.and all anyone can think about is that special someone lying next to them dreaming sweetly with their face so peaceful they almost look angelic. That personable ditty we're listening to now captures this tender feeling perfectly, don't you agree? Here's The Chordettes singing Mr. Sandman for the loveliest couple under our radio waves tonight!
