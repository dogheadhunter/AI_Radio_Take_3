New Vegas, I've got a little song here that will make you smile it reminds me of lazy afternoons in the shade with someone special. Here are The Andrews Sisters crooning about not wanting to get caught while courting under Momma's apple tree! Don’t Sit Under the Apple Tree by The Andrews Sisters is up next, straight from Radio New Vegas for your listening pleasure tonight.
