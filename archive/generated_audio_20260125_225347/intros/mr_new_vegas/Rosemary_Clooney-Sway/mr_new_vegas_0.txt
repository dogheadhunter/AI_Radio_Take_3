The night air in New Vegas is balmy, the neon lights of the casinos shimmering like a siren call across the desert. And you know what they say about those who can't resist. this next song goes out to all my lovely listeners surrendering to temptation tonight. Rosemary Clooney's silky smooth voice will have you swaying with every sultry note as she croons 'Sway'.
