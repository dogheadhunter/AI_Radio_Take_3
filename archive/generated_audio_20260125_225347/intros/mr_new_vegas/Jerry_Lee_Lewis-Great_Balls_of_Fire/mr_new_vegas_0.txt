My darlings in the Mojave, how I adore this song! It starts off all tender and sweet like a warm embrace on a cool desert night. But before you know it, those great big balls start rollin' faster than my Thunderbird racing down Highway 95! So buckle up as we ride Jerry Lee Lewis into that inferno of passion with. Great Balls of Fire by the one and only King Creole himself!
