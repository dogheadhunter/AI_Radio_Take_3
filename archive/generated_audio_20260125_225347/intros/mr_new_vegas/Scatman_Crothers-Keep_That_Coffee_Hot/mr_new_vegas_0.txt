Ladies and gentlemen of New Vegas, let me ask you this: is there anything quite like the warmth and comfort that a piping hot cup of joe can bring to your day? As far as I'm concerned, it's up there with finding love in the desert or discovering an oasis on one of these long Mojave highways. That feeling when those first drops hit your tongue. pure bliss! Which is why this next tune by Scatman Crothers resonates so deeply within me and perhaps you too reminding us to cherish that daily ritual, even amidst life's trials and tribulations. Here's Keep That Coffee Hot from the one and only Mr. Scatman himself!
