Alright, ladies and gentlemen of the Mojave desert! I've got a real treat for you next how about some smooth R&B from ? This one goes out to all my hardworking listeners putting in overtime tonight. Can't help but wonder if anyone's clocking sixty minutes on that factory floor right now. Ah, who am I kidding? It probably feels like more than an hour! Well here are Billy Ward & The Dominoes with the song of your dreams Sixty Minute Man coming up next for you all to enjoy while we count down those precious remaining seconds till quitting time.
