New Vegas, let me share this beautiful melancholy tune with you. In the lyrics we find an acceptance of fleeting love and the impermanence that comes with it like grasping at something as ephemeral as 'just paper. ' So poignant! Here's Ella Fitzgerald & The Delta Rhythm Boys singing It’s Only a Paper Moon, reminding us to cherish what little time passion allows before drifting away on life's tides.
