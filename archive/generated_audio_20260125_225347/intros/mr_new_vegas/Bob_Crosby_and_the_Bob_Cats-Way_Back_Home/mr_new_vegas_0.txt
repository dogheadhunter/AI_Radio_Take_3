Ladies, gentlemen of New Vegas. When I listen to these melancholy notes from our next tune, my heart aches for those who've had their fair share of wanderlust. It seems so many souls are forever drifting away in search of something elusive out there on the horizon maybe it's adventure or perhaps they're running from what they left behind. The yearning echoes through Bob Crosby and the Bob Cats' 'Way Back Home'.
