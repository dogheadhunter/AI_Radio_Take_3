New Vegas, how can I put into words just what this song means to me? Is there anyone out here riding from town to town in their convertible with nothing but a suitcase and an irresistible charm like our man does? Here comes Roger Miller crooning about being 'the king,' living life on his own terms that's the kind of spirit we need more of. And you look extraordinarily beautiful right now as I spin this tune for your ears only. Roger Miller, King of the Road!
