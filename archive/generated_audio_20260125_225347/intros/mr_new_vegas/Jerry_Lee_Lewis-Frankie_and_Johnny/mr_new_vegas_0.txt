Ladies, the heat of New Vegas can melt a man right down to his soul. But when he finds that someone special like you beautiful folks tuning in tonight there ain't nothing hotter than two hearts beating as one. Now, let me play something real for y'all about those intense desert romances and star crossed lovers who'd risk everything. This next song is Jerry Lee Lewis with Frankie and Johnny!
