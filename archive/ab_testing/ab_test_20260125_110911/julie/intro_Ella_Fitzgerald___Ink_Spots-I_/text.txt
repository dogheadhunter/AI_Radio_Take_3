So this song, it makes me wonder: Can you really ever get over someone? Because even after all that time has passed and things didn't work out between them in her words here "it was meant to be but never came" Ella still feels those same emotions. Maybe some wounds just take forever to heal. Here's the incomparable Ella Fitzgerald, paired with The Ink Spots for this song about lingering love. I Still Feel the Same About You.
