Good evening, everyone! As we start our drive home tonight, keep in mind that the temperature is going to be a chilly -15 degrees Fahrenheit. Don't forget to bundle up! We're under an overcast sky right now, but there's some good news: the forecast for tomorrow morning looks mostly sunny with only a slight chance of snow flurries early in the morning. Stay safe and warm out there, listeners!
