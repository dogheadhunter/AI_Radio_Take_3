Ladies and gentlemen, as we settle into the cool evening hours, I've got some updates on our atmospheric conditions. Right now, it's a frigid -15 degrees out there under the overcast skies. So bundle up if you're heading outdoors! But don't worry, my friends, we have some respite coming your way. As night falls and tomorrow morning dawns, temperatures will begin to rise slightly. So stay warm, keep those heaters on, and tune in for more weather updates right here on our radio station. Remember, life's too short not to enjoy the best Vegas lounge tunes while staying informed about the weather!
